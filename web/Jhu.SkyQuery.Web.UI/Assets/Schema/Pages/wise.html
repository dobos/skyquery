    <h3>Source Catalog</h3>

    <p>
        The WISE Source Catalog contains the attributes
        for <b>563,921,584</b> point-like and resolved objects detected on the
        Atlas Intensity images.
        Catalog sources are required to have a measured
        <b>SNR&gt;5</b> in at least one band, and to meet other criteria
        to insure a high degree of reliability.
        Attributes included for each entry in the Source Catalog include:

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                J2000 positions and uncertainties reconstructed using the
                <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AJ....131.1163S">2MASS</a> Point
                Source Catalog as astrometric reference.  Astrometric accuracy is
                approximately ~200 mas RMS on each axis with respect to the
                <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AJ....131.1163S">2MASS</a>
                reference frame for sources brighter than SNR=40.
            </li>
            <li>
                Photometry and uncertainties in the four WISE bands.  Photometry
                is performed using point source profile-fitting and multi-aperture photometry.
                WISE 5&sigma; photometric sensitivity is estimated to be
                0.068, 0.098, 0.86 and 5.4 mJy (16.6, 15.6, 11.3, 8.0 Vega mag) at
                3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 &mu;m in unconfused regions on the ecliptic
                plane.  Sensitivity is better at higher ecliptic latitudes where
                coverage is deeper and the zodiacal background is lower, and poorer
                when limited by confusion in high source density or complex background
                regions. Saturation affects photometry
                for sources brighter than approximately 8.1, 6.7, 3.8 and -0.4 mag
                at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 &mu;m, respectively.

            <li>
                Measurement quality flags,
                image artifact contamination flags, extended source and variability
                flags, and association information cross-referencing WISE sources with the
                <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AJ....131.1163S">2MASS</a>
                Point and Extended Source Catalogs.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <p>
        Relative photometric calibration for WISE source photometry is made using
        measurements of a network of calibration standard stars near the ecliptic
        poles. The <b>WISE bandpasses and relative spectral response curves</b>
        are available
        in <a href="http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allsky/expsup/sec4_4h.html#WISEZMA">Section IV.4.h.v</a> of the
        WISE All-Sky Release Explanatory Supplement.
